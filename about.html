<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Dear All, My name is Alvina Washington and I am living in Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India since childhood. I have my parents and a younger brother. My Father is retired from the Indian Army and my mother is a house maker. My younger brother completed his graduation in B.Sc. IT.

<p>Dehradun is a hill station and there are many rivers but two main Holy rivers called The Ganges and The Yamuna according to Hindu Ideology. Mussoorie is called "The Queen of Hills" which is 30 kilometer from Dehradun. Some other visiting places are Haridwar, Rishikes and Chakrata etc.</p>

<p>I did my early education from Jesus and MAry's Convent school, Meerut. After then I came to Dehradun and did secondary and senior secondary with Science stream. After that i fall sick so after few years I started again and Did B.A.(Sociology, English, Education) then B.Ed, MSW and M.Ed. In 2018 I started Ph.D. in Education but due to COVID19 and some other issues i quit from the course.
  
</p>
<p>Now I restart my career in IT because It is my school time hobby thats why i did basics in 1997.
  Nowadays I am learning "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu from Udemy.

<p>Thank You.</p>
